# STEREO_DSO_ROS

This is a minimal example of how to integrate STEREO DSO from a ROS project, and run it on real-time input data. You can test it with EuRoC and KITTI Dataset(rosbag), or you may run it with your stereo camera(ROS API).

Detail about STEREO DSO: https://github.com/HorizonAD/stereo_dso

Assume that you are familiar with ROS. If you are not familiar with ROS, you can refer to the following link to install and learn how to use ROS.

# 1. Installation

## 1.1. Install stereo_dso

Install the stereo_dso as the instruction of the following link:

https://github.com/HorizonAD/stereo_dso

## 1.2. Install stereo_dso_ros

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src

git clone https://github.com/LinHuican/stereo_dso_ros

cd ..

catkin_make
```

# 2 Examples

### KITTI dataset
Dowload KITTI rosbag sequences:http://cifasis-conicet.gov.ar/taihu/datasets/KITTI/bags/

```
rosrun stereo_dso_ros stero_dso_ros calib=/home/huicanlin/catkin_ws/src/stereo_dso_ros/examples/camera_kitti.txt preset=0 mode=1 /cam0/image_raw:=/kitti_stereo/left/image_rect /cam1/image_raw:=kitti_stereo/right/image_rect
```

```
rosbag play --pause ~/Downloads/Dataset/KITTI/kitti_00.bag
```

### EuRoC dataset

The performance of the STEREO DSO ROS in the EuRoc dataset is not satisfactory and still needs improvement.

```
rosrun stereo_dso_ros stero_dso_ros calib=/home/huicanlin/catkin_ws/src/stereo_dso_ros/examples/camera_euroc.txt preset=0 mode=1
```

```
rosbag play --pause ~/Downloads/Dataset/ETH/V1_01_easy.bag
```

For poor computing power, you may try:

```
rosbag play --pause ~/Downloads/Dataset/ETH/V1_01_easy.bag -r 0.5
```

### Own stereo camera

```
rosrun stereo_dso_ros stero_dso_ros calib=/home/huicanlin/catkin_ws/src/stereo_dso_ros/examples/own_camera.txt preset=0 mode=1 /cam0/image_raw:=/own_left_camera /cam1/image_raw:=/own_left_camera
```
```
Publish own left and right camera.
```
